## Defines the lookup table for the computer player
## Each possible move is cehcked against the patterns below and scored with the value of $v additively
## that should in theory make moves which acomlish more than one thing more likely to be played
##
## note: all definitions are additionally loaded as mirrors so there is no need to define a reverse manually
##
## 1 = friendly 
## 2 = enemy
## $v = value of move
## !break : if match till now abort used for forced moves
##
## all combinations that don' exceed a length of 4 from v are valid
